I'm an cross-disciplinary technology policy scholar researching the fairness, transparency and resilience of algorithmic systems as part of a doctorate at [UCL STEaPP](http://ucl.ac.uk/steapp) and [UCL Computer Science](http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/home/). I investigate high-stakes, value-charged, algorithmically-informed decisions in areas such as policing, justice or humanitarian response, as well as more fully automatic systems that might restrict rights or freedoms online or in connected environments. Together with stellar collaborators, I investigate these issues from [legal](https://ssrn.com/abstract=2972855), [administrative](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.09249), and [statistical](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.01477) standpoints. I previously worked at the [Royal Society as a data governance researcher](https://royalsociety.org/topics-policy/projects/data-governance/), in [IoT and ageing governance at the European Commission](https://ec.europa.eu/eip/ageing/home_en), and at [Bonsucro](http://bonsucro.com) as a data scientist. I hold a BSc from [LSE](http://www.lse.ac.uk) and an MSc from [Maastricht University](http://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl).

I [tweet too much](http://www.twitter.com/mikarv). For the curious, lists of my <a href="/publications/">publications</a> and recent <a href="/talks">talks</a> can be found here.
